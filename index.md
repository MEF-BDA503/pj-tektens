# The Progress Journal

## Week 2 (Oct 15)

+ [Here](files/st_homework_1.html) is my 5 interesting R examples.

### Udacity Update 
I've finished Lesson 1 & 2 on the Udacity course.

### Git Problem Solved
Since there is Github Desktop available for Ubuntu, I had to find another solution in order to submit HW1. First I've found that GitKraken is a common Git Client for Linux. Secondly, I've faced a permission problem related to my account & Github Class. Therefore I've forked classroom files into my own account, and then pulled&changed&commit&pushed to my own account and lastly submit a pull request to my classroom. With this workaround, I can make changes locally and sync with classroom account without any problem. Today's gain is that I've learnt forking, pushing, pulling and merging using Github.
